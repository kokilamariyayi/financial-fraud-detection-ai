# FINANCIAL_FRAUD_DETECTION-SYSTEM
# AI-Powered Financial Fraud Detection System

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using
machine learning techniques under extreme class imbalance conditions.

## Problem Statement
Financial fraud detection is a critical task where fraudulent transactions
represent a very small fraction of total transactions. The challenge lies in
accurately identifying fraud while minimizing false positives.

## Approach
- Performed detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Engineered balance-based and transaction-based features
- Handled class imbalance using class-weighted learning
- Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline
- Trained a Logistic Regression model for fraud classification
- Saved the trained pipeline using `joblib` for reuse without retraining

## Model
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Handling Imbalance: Class-weighted loss
- Output: Binary classification (Fraud / Not Fraud)

## Repository Structure
- `data/` → Dataset description and source link
- `notebooks/` → Complete model development notebook
- `model/` → Trained fraud detection pipeline
- `requirements.txt` → Project dependencies

## Key Highlights
- No dataset uploaded due to large size
- Model trained once and reused via saved pipeline
- Suitable for real-world deployment scenarios

## Future Enhancements
- Threshold tuning using Precision-Recall tradeoff
- Ensemble models for improved recall
- Deployment using REST API or Streamlit
